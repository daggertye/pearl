# Prototypes for Every Applicable RL algorithm (PEARL)

This is a host of all of the main rl algorithms I come across. Everything from on-policy to off-policy, model-based to model free will be included here. This code will not implement any super-special heuristics to help converge on specific environments and doesn't serve as a baseline for any rl challenge. Instead, it will be useful for learning purposes (to understand the algorithms themselves).
